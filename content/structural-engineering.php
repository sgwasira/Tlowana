      <div class="panel-body">A structure designed to fulfill a specific function in industry or to support or house equipment, raw materials, or communication lines. In modern industrial construction, more than 25 percent of the total cost of construction and installation work is attributed to industrial structures.<br><br>

There are more than 100 different types of industrial structures. They are conventionally divided into the following major groups:<br><br>

(1) communication structures, including conduits and pipelines for electrical power networks and for transmitting raw materials, tunnels, power transmission line towers, communication line poles, illumination masts, and chimneys;<br><br>

(2) transportation structures, including overpasses, unloading and crane platforms, and tunnels for conveyors;<br><br>

(3) tanks for gaseous and liquid products and bulk materials and structures for ventilation, drainage, and water and gas supply systems, including bunkers, gasholders, oil storage tanks, silos, water towers and pressure reservoirs, spray ponds, cooling towers, settling reservoirs, water intake works, and sewage treatment plants;<br><br>

(4) structures to support and house production machinery, including foundations for equipment and machines, bases for installing industrial apparatus, caissons, and racks.<br><br>

Industrial structures are most characteristic of the chemical, metallurgical, and mining industries. Their use is steadily rising as a result of the increasing tendency to place industrial equipment in the open areas outside industrial premises and the increasing concentration of equipment in industrial plants. Most industrial structures are predominantly reinforced-concrete and steel structures, including supports, platforms, chimneys, silos, and tanks. In some cases, structures of bonded wood are suitable for platforms and ventilating towers.<br><br>

Increased efficiency in the construction of industrial structures is achieved by using prefabrications and by standardization of the entire structure or its separate elements. Standard designs have been developed for many industrial structures, which make possible the employment of advanced technical ideas and the most efficient use of existing production facilities in the construction industry.</div>

      <div class="panel-body"><b>Types of commercial property</b><br><br>

Commercial real estate is commonly divided into six categories:<br><br>

1. Office Buildings – This category includes single‐tenant properties, small professional office buildings, downtown skyscrapers, and everything in between.<br><br>

2. Industrial – This category ranges from smaller properties, often called "Flex" or "R&D" properties, to larger office service or office warehouse properties to the very large industrial properties.We also consider the type and number of docks that the property has.<br><br>

3. Retail/Restaurant – This category includes pad sites on highway frontages, single tenant retail buildings, small neighborhood shopping centers, larger centers with grocery store anchor tenants.<br><br>

4. Multifamily – This category includes apartment complexes or high‐rise apartment buildings. Generally, anything larger than a fourplex is considered commercial real estate.<br><br>

5. Land – This category includes investment properties on undeveloped, raw, rural land in the path of future development. Or, infill land with an urban area, pad sites, and more.<br><br>

6. Miscellaneous – This catch all category would include any other nonresidential properties such as hotel, hospitality, medical, and self‐storage developments, as well as many more.</div>

      <div class="panel-body">A building should be regarded as residential building when more than half of the floor area is used for dwelling purposes. Other buildings should be regarded as non-residential. <br><br>

Two types of residential buildings can be distinguished: <br><br>

- houses (ground-oriented residential buildings): comprising all types of houses (detached, semi- detached, terraced houses, houses built in a row, etc.) each dwelling of which has its own entrance directly from the ground surface; <br><br>

- other residential buildings: comprising all residential buildings other than ground-oriented residential buildings as defined above.</div>

      <div class="panel-body">The process of creating and building infrastructure or a facility. It differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser and construction is typically done on location for a known client. Construction as an industry is six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries. Construction starts with planning, design, and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use.<br><br>


Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking. Normally, the job is managed by a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, Architecture has to do with planning, designing and constructing form, space and ambience to reflect functional, technical, social, environmental and aesthetic considerations. It requires the creative manipulation and coordination of materials and technology, and of light and shadow. Often, conflicting requirements must be resolved. The practice of Architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realizing buildings and structures, including scheduling, cost estimation and construction administration. Documentation produced by architects, typically drawings, plans and technical specifications, defines the structure and/or behavior of a building or other kind of system that is to be or has been constructed, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect. For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential. Those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider the zoning requirements, the environmental impact of the job, the successful scheduling, budgeting, construction site safety, availability and transportation of building materials, logistics, inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding, etc.<br><br></div>
